============

Rough Android Wear prototype to show the next train time for the WMATA Metro System. This is meant for people's normal daily commutes (between home and work metro stations).

On phone app, one time user input of: 
- Your home metro station (e.g. West Falls Church)
- The end of line station for your home metro station (e.g. Vienna)
- Your work metro station (e.g. Clarendon)
- The end of line station for your work metro station (e.g. New Carrollton)

On watch app:
- Displays how many minutes until the next train, tap screen to refresh

**Currently, will only work if your home and work stations are on the same line**
**No GPS location is currently used, but that would be a welcome enhancement to reduce user input via phone app**
